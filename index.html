            <p>My name is John Chambers. I am currently a student at the UCI Coding Bootcamp, a rigorous program that has had me at times question who I am. Anywyas, It is a pretty safe assumption that I am relatively tech savy and love the Internet. In addition, I am also a lover of music and animals. I am somewhat of an Ableton Live nerd and I also used to have a blue and gold macaw a.k.a. a parot. When I am not staring at a computer screen I tend to spend a lot of time with my family and friends.
